        <h1>Desert Rat at Heart</h1>
        <p>While I've now living in Austin Texas for over ten years, I am still very much a desert rat at heart. I spend most of my life in Southern Arizona, where hot has a whole new definition.</p>
        <blockquote>The best smell in the world is the desert right before it rains</blockquote>
        <noscript>No really, it a smell you cannot recreate</noscript>
        <p>It's funny the things you get excited about when you spent most of your life in the desert.</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Water</dt>
            <dd>Large bodies of water seem miraculous to me.</dd>
          <dt>Shade</dt>
            <dd>You have never seen anything funnier then a bunch of people parking in the boonies, just so they can get a shady spot</dd>
          <dt>Green Things</dt> 
            <dd><strong>TREES! OMG TREES!</strong>Those make shade too</dd>
          <dt>Weather that is not just heat</dt>
            <dd>Yes, it's still hot in Texas, but I can actually go outside in the summer</dd>
          <dt>That I cannot cook my lunch in my car</dt>  
            <dd>No joke, I made pot pies in my car in college.</dd>
          <dt>I do not have to drive with oven mitts</dt>
            <dd>Yes, I did actually do this and got second degree burns from seat belts.</dd>

        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>I spend most <del>of my time at work</del> <ins>weekends on the Green Belt</ins>, with my dog, <big>Gruff</big> and hanging out with my husband, Karlen, <small>(he's awesome)</small>.</p>
        <h3><em>This is Very Important!</em></h3>
        <p>We need to talk about food!</p>
        <p> I <u>love</u> food! All food! <sub>even though some of it is trying to kill me.</sub> </p>
        <p>I don't have a favorite food, I just love it all. <br> My husband still laughs at me and my family since we will be eat one meal and discussing the next one, or an amazing recipe we just found.</p>
